              Hello everyone! <br />
              <br />With 2022 in full swing we felt it was time once again to
              post an update of what has happened since we last shared. Over the
              last five months there has been tremendous growth and activity
              within our community. On the d2jsp staff side we've gone through
              25 staff promotions, 5 staff retirements and have added 13 new
              trusted members. We have also been hard at work improving the
              community and the overall user experience through over 100 site
              updates, changes and new features. The full list of updates and
              changes can be found below. <br />
              <br />
              The record on the fastest Ladder Slasher reset was set, where bdan
              reset the Softcore Ladder in 8 days, 22 hours and 15 minutes. For
              those of you who are not familiar with Ladder Slasher, it is a
              free RPG game that you can play in your web browser, on your
              desktop or mobile device. I encourage you to check it out if you
              haven't done so.
              <br />
              <br />
              With the release of Diablo 2:Resurrected we saw an explosion of
              activity shattering our online user record to over 30,000
              simultaneous online users. <br />
              <br />This activity was responsible for over 6.2 million trade
              topics composed just shy of 21.5 million posts. <br />
              <br />With the announcement of patch 2.4 we have quite a bit to
              look forward to such as Ladder Rank Play, Class Balance Changes,
              Mercenary Changes & New Rune Words! <br />
              <br />You can find all the details in the announcement here:
              https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo2/23746135/diablo-ii-resurrected-patch-2-4-highlights-coming-soon.
              Here are the official ptr patch notes if you're interested:
              https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo2/23765907/diablo-ii-resurrected-patch-2-4-balance-ptr
              We have been told to expect the first ever Ladder Rank play to
              start early in 2022 and are very excited! <br />
              <br />With the trading brought to us from Diablo 2:Resurrected we
              are happy to announce a complete rewrite and launch of our free,
              safe and secure trade mediation service. We have been able to get
              the wait times down to an average of one minute from request to
              first contact. This would have never been possible without the
              amazing support of our staff and mediators. We thank you for all
              of your continued help in keeping trades safe and secure. If you
              haven't yet used our free mediation service we highly encourage
              you to check it out. It's as simple as one click at the top of
              your trade topic to ensure fast, safe and secure trades. There is
              some more information on this free service in the site article:
              How To Request A Mediator And Prevent Scams. As promised here is a

              Hello everyone! <br /><br />
              We have made many updates and changes over the last few months.
              Many of them have been visual, but there have been numerous
              feature updates as well. Additionally, many backend changes have
              also been made that should help both continue to keep performance
              solid, while also adding even more redundancy and future-proofing.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Diablo II: Resurrected release is also around the corner on
